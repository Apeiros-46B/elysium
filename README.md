Heavily WIP.

elysium is a neutral, muted light theme.

# Flavors
- **wisp**: Low contrast
- **haze**: Medium contrast
- **cloud**: High contrast

# Ports
- None yet.

# Design philosophy
1. Background and foreground tones should be neutral. It should be up to the user to alter temperature through a global program like [redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift).
2. The color palette should be around the same luminance as each other and be slightly muted.

# FAQ
- Q: Dark mode?  
  A: This is not planned, but if you like elysium, you may like [Paradise](https://github.com/paradise-theme/paradise) and [Mountain](https://github.com/mountain-theme/Mountain).
