# Design philosophy
1. Background and foreground tones should be neutral. It should be up to the user to alter temperature through a global program like [redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift).
2. The other colors should be around the same luminance as each other and be slightly muted. They should be desaturated, but have just the right amount of contrast where they're still distinguishable from each other and easy to read from the background tones.

# FAQ
- Q: Dark mode?  
  A: This is not planned, but if you like elysium, you may like [Paradise](https://github.com/paradise-theme/paradise) and [Mountain](https://github.com/mountain-theme/Mountain).
